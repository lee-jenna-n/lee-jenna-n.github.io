<h2>Hello! I'm Jenna.</h2>

I work as a software engineer. I graduated from the University of Virginia in December 2015 with degrees in Computer Science and Psychology and a minor in Mathematics. 
I love working on aspects of technology that directly impact user experience. When working on a project, I always consider usability, design, and accessibility. 
Because of my interest in math, I also find joy in solving logic problems. <br><br>

Currently, I do full-stack web development. You can see some of the projects I have worked on in my <a href="#/portfolio">portfolio</a>.

My other passions include music and fitness. In my free time, you can find me playing guitar, working out at the gym, or cuddling with my dog.
