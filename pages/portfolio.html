<h3><a href="#/portfolio/cssAnimation">CSS Animation</a></h3>
I enjoy playing around with CSS to make fun animations. The animations on my site are created with icons from <a href="http://fontawesome.io">Font Awesome</a>.

<h3><a href="#/portfolio/javaScript">JavaScript</a></h3>
This site is made with AngularJS, and other projects I've done utilize ReactJS.

<h3><a href="#/portfolio/java">Java</a></h3>
Java was my very first programming language, and is still one of my favorites.
